# microtonal-modulation-juce
A MIDI-effect plugin intended to allowing for modulation in microtonal tunings. Uses MPE + pitch bend. Compatible with .scl, and .kbm files. Prototyped in Max/MSP and developed with JUCE.

The functionality of this project is mostly complete. Currently, I am in the process of designing a good/easy to use UI system. After I do so, this README will be updated. This update will:
<ul>
<li>explain how to use the plugin,</li>
<li>explain this repo's structure,</li>
<li>include liscencing information (currently all rights are reserved), and</li>
<li>include some example routing in DAWs.</li>
</ul>
